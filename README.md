### 🧭 About Me

I’m a Product Manager with over 8 years of experience delivering large-scale ICT projects and digital products across telecom and enterprise environments.  
My work focuses on bridging business needs and technical delivery, leading distributed teams, and achieving reliable outcomes in complex contexts.

I enjoy bringing structure and clarity to ambiguous problems and turning strategy into execution.  
Currently I’m exploring how AI and data-driven approaches can enhance product strategy and operational efficiency.
