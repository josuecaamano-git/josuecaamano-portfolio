### 🧭 About Me

I’m a Product Manager with over 8 years of experience delivering large-scale ICT projects and digital products across telecom and enterprise environments.  
My work has focused on aligning business needs with technical solutions, leading distributed teams, and ensuring reliable delivery in complex, regulated contexts.

I enjoy bringing structure and clarity to ambiguous problems, enabling cross-functional collaboration, and turning strategic goals into concrete outcomes.  
Currently, I’m exploring how AI and data-driven approaches can enhance product strategy, user experience, and operational efficiency.
